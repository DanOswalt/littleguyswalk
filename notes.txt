how to add firebase to get two (or more) guys walking around

will need to refactor a little bit to get each image as a separate instance

will the animations happen the same way for both?

user A logs in. he gets a sprite, it's coordinates are updated by him and saved in firestore.

we need a document that maps the data to the sprite.

when user B logs in, a new sprite will get created on user A's screen when the doc appears in fb.

will need the info for drawFrame. { sequenceFrame, direction, x, y }

how to sync up the requestAnimationFrame with db requests?

on firebase change -> drawFrame -> requestAnimationFrame

the sprite has state, it doesn't animate itself, it knows its state, perhaps the current frame does go here
